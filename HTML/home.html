                Hello, I'm Jinit Limbachiya, a second-year Computer Engineering diploma student at RCTI Ahmedabad. I have a
                solid understanding of C, C++, HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I actively share my projects and coding
                experiences online through Instagram, X, LinkedIn, and GitHub, where I post videos and updates about my latest
                work and learning journeys.
                <br><br>
                Beyond coding, I'm deeply passionate about filmmaking. I love writing scripts and enjoy editing videos in my
                free time. Astronomy fascinates me, especially topics like Dark Matters, Extraterrestrial Life, Black Holes
                and Worm Holes which fuel my curiosity and drive to learn more about these incredible phenomena.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my notable achievements is winning an award at Hackathon 2024 at BBIT, Anand. This experience not only
                honed my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of teamwork and innovation in problem-solving.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I had the honor of receiving recognition from NASA's 9th chief, Dan Goldin, for my project
                "Planetary Weight Calculator." This project, designed to calculate weight on different planets in our solar
                system, reflects my ability to combine technical expertise with my love for astronomy.
