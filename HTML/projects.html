            I have developed a website for streaming movies, TV shows, anime, and sitcoms, utilizing HTML and CSS to create a
            seamless and engaging user experience. The website features a trending page that highlights the most popular and
            current content, ensuring users stay updated with the latest entertainment options.
            <br><br>
            This project aims to provide a comprehensive streaming platform where users can easily find and watch their
            favorite shows and movies. The intuitive design and user-friendly interface make it simple to navigate through
            different genres and categories.
            <br><br>
            I am excited about the potential of this website to become a go-to destination for entertainment enthusiasts.
            By incorporating a trending page, we ensure that users can quickly discover new and popular content, enhancing
            their viewing experience.

        <p>I have developed a website called "Planetary Weight Calculator" that allows users to calculate their weight on
            other planets in our solar system by entering their weight on Earth. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript to provide a user-friendly and interactive experience.

            I am thrilled to share that Dan Goldin, NASA's 9th Chief, has reacted positively to my project. His
            acknowledgment and support are a great honor and a testament to the project's potential and impact.
            <br><br>
            The "Planetary Weight Calculator" aims to educate and engage users by demonstrating how gravity varies across
            different planets. This project not only highlights the fascinating differences in planetary environments but
            also sparks curiosity about space exploration and science.
